# Contributing

Contributions to the project are always welcome and encouraged, if you intend to contribute,
be sure follow the guidelines in this document.

# Code Style

To keep the code consistent, please follow the guidelines below where possible:
- If statements should use parentheses around the condition `if (condition) then`
- Parentheses should not be padded with spaces
- `!` should be used in place of `not` and `~`
- `||` and `&&` should be avoided, use `or` and `and` instead
- Function names should use `PascalCase`
- File globals that are mutable should use `PascalCase`
- Scoped local variables and arguments should use `camelCase`
- Global constants (including file global constants) should be entirely uppercase with underscores for separation
- Global functions should be avoided, prefer local functions.
If you need a global function, put it in the `gRust` table
- `pl` should be used in place of `ply` for variables that refer to a player

If you want a reference point for how code should look in this repository,
[freelook_cl.lua](gamemode/core/player/freelook_cl.lua) is a good example

# Bug Fixes
