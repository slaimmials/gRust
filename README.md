# About

gRust is a Garry's Mod gamemode written from the ground up with the aim of recreating the
experience from the survival game [Rust](https://rust.facepunch.com) within [Garry's Mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com)

# Playing

The recommended way to play gRust is on the official servers, but you can also play on unofficial servers
or start a game locally in singleplayer/multiplayer mode.

### Browse for Servers

You can browse the server list by finding "gRust" in the Garry's Mod gamemode list after clicking "Find Multiplayer Game".

### Playing on Official Servers

The official gRust community is [gRust.co](https://grust.co), the servers are as follows:
- EU Vanilla - `connect 51.89.178.178:27018`
- EU Modded 2x - `connect 51.75.174.11:27015`
- EU Modded 5x - `connect 51.75.174.11:27029`
- EU Modded 10x - `connect 51.75.174.11:27044`

- US Modded 5x - `connect 147.135.124.10:27026`
  
Simply enter one of the `connect` commands above into your console and you should start connecting.
  
### Playing Locally (Singleplayer/Multiplayer)

The best way to play locally is to simply download it on the workshop using the following link:
> **gRust - Rust in Garry's Mod**  
> https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=TODO
  
You can also clone this repository into `steamapps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/gamemodes/rust` if you want the most up to date version.
To update, simply run `git pull` in the gamemode's root directory.
  
It is recommended that you download a map that supports the gRust gamemode for a playable expereince, here is the most popular:
> **rust_highland**  
> https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=TODO

Once downloaded, simply (re)open Garry's Mod and select the "Rust" gamemode on the bottom right of the main menu,
click "Start New Game", and select a map from the "Rust" category. If you want to play with friends, change the
max player count on the top right (it is set to "Single Player" by default). You can now press "Start Game" on
the bottom right and invite your friends.

# Reporting Issues
